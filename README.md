# Sales Data Analysis using Python & Pandas## ?? Project OverviewThis project involves analyzing a sales dataset to generate meaningful business insights using Python and pandas.  The purpose of the project is to clean raw sales data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), create visualizations, and summarize insights that support business decision-making.This project was created as part of my data analysis learning journey and reflects real-world data challenges such as missing values, inconsistent data types, and categorical inconsistencies.---## ?? Tools & Technologies- Python  - Pandas  - Matplotlib  - Jupyter Notebook  ---## ?? Data Cleaning & PreparationThe following data preprocessing steps were performed:- Identified and handled missing values  - Converted numeric columns (`quantity`, `unit_price`, `discount_applied`) to proper data types  - Standardized categorical columns such as delivery status and payment method  - Converted the order date column into datetime format  - Removed invalid and duplicate records  - Created a revenue column by applying discounts to sales values  ---## ?? Analysis Performed- Total revenue calculation  - Monthly revenue trend analysis  - Revenue distribution by region  - Identification of top-performing products  - Analysis of delivery status performance  - Evaluation of discount impact on revenue  ---## ?? VisualizationsThe following visualizations were created to support the analysis:- Monthly revenue trend (line chart)  - Revenue by region (bar chart)  - Top 10 products by revenue  - Delivery status distribution  ---## ?? Key Business Insights- Revenue varies significantly across regions, indicating differences in regional performance.  - Monthly revenue trends suggest fluctuations that may reflect seasonal buying behavior.  - A small number of products contribute a large share of overall revenue.  - Delivery delays and cancellations highlight potential areas for operational improvement.  - Discounts increase order volume but reduce per-order revenue, suggesting the need for optimized discount strategies.  ---## ?? Personal Learning & ObservationsWhile working on this project, I gained hands-on experience in cleaning real-world data and handling common issues such as inconsistent data types and missing values.  This project strengthened my understanding of pandas, exploratory data analysis, and how to translate analytical results into clear business insights.---## ? ConclusionThis project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow—from raw data cleaning to visualization and insight generation—using Python and pandas.  It reflects practical skills relevant to entry-level data analyst roles.---## ??
